## final week assignment
In this project,
I added User Input to the group work, including mouse click interactions and keyboard input interactions. I wanted to express the psychological distortions and cries of the characters in the painting through different interactions in the variants.
The interactions include:
1. When the mouse clicks on an area of the screen, a rectangle centred on the mouse creates the effect of the image fragments scattering, and when all the fragments have been clicked on and disappeared, only a blank background remains. The power of the shout is reflected by the broken image when clicked by the mouse, and the sound of the shout will shatter the screen.
2. When clicking on the keyboard, the colour blocks in the image will exchange positions. Expresses the inner distortion of the character.
